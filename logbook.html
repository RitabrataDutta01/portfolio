            <h2>Welcome to Logbook</h2>
            <p>
                This is a simple logbook app which allows you to keep daily logs of your work/progress and review them at the beginning of each day. The app is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy for anyone to use.

            <p>
                I started working on this project on 27th May 2025 and finished it on the same day. I got the idea for this project due to personal need to keep logs on my progress and review them so I don't have to spend time everyday searching for what I got done the day before.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app allows users to create profiles and log in using a user-generated ID and password. Each user can maintain separate logs for different profiles, such as professional or personal. Logs are stored in a database and can be searched by date or keywords, making it easy to find specific entries.

                The main interface displays only the log headings and timestamps for clarity. Users can double-click on any entry to expand it and view full details. Both user credentials and log entries are stored in the same database but managed through separate tables.

                The entire GUI is built using Tkinter, continuing the design and usability approach from my previous projects.
