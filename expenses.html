                I started working on this project on 03rd April 2025 and finished it on 05th April 2025. I got the idea for this project by asking ChatGPT to suggest Python project ideas. This Expense Tracker was one of the suggestions, and I decided to work on it during my free time.

                This apps allows its users to add their daily expenses, categorize them, and view a summary of their spending. The app uses a simple Tkinter GUI for user interaction and stores the data in a local SQLite database, along with a grpah to visualize the expenses. The app is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it a great tool for anyone looking to manage their finances more effectively. The user can also change the modes of the graph to view the total expenses in a day by day comparison or the expense comparison of a particular day.
