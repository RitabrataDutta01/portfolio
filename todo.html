        <h2>Welcome to To-Do list</h2>
        <p>
            This is a simple to-do list gui app made with tkinter that allows you to keep track of your tasks. The app is made to be user-friendly and easy to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started work on this project on 10th April 2025 and finished it on the same day. I got the idea for this project by teacher recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This simple app allows users to make a todo list and mark things out by double clicking. It is just a barebones version of a todo list app and I have some more feature in mind
            like user auth and date wise search and adding items, when I get around to it, I will update the link here as well.
