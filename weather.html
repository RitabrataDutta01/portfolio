            <h2>Welcome to the Weather App</h2>
            <p>
                This is a simple weather app that allows you to check the current temperature and weather conditions in any city around the world. The app is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy for anyone to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started working on this app and finished it on 22nd March 2025. I got the idea for this project by asking ChatGPT to suggest Python project ideas. This Weather App was the first suggestion from a list of 20 ideas, and it is the one I decided to work on during my recuperation.
            </p>
            <p>
                This app takes the name of a city as input from the user through a Tkinter window, fetches the current temperature in that city along with the weather description, and displays them in a table that can hold up to 5 queries at a time. Once the queries exceed 5, the oldest one is deleted and the queries are shifted up. Additionally, there is a table showing a 3-day forecast for the city queried by the user. This app uses the <a href="https://www.api.weather.com" target="_blank">weather.com</a> free-tier API to fetch weather data.
